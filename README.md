### Introduction

The Matterport 3D Showcase SDK is a javascript library for third-party developers to integrate Matterport with their web applications. Developers can deeply customize the 3D Showcase experience and build entire applications off of Matterport, enabling many exciting new use cases.

### SDK for Embeds

With this SDK, developers can

* Execute actions to control 3D Showcase from their web app. For example, the user clicks a button on a webpage and moves to a specific location in the Matterport Space.
* Listen to events from 3D Showcase and respond in their web app. For example, play a sound or voiceover when the user goes to a certain location in the Matterport Space.
