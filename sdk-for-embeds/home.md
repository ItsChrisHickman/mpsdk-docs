**Important: Tags 2.0 will become the new default soon, replacing Mattertags.**

We will continue to support Mattertags (Tags 1.0) until March 1, 2023, after which Tags 2.0 will become the only available implementation.  ****  Until that date, by including an `&applicationKey` URL parameter, the default Tag implementation will remain Mattertags. &#x20;

This mostly only affects visuals. All SDK functionality provided by the `Mattertag` namespace will continue to work as is with Tags 2.0
