### Explore the Reference Docs

We’ve organized our [SDK reference docs](https://matterport.github.io/showcase-sdk/docs/reference/current/index.html) around modules (features) within 3D Showcase. If you’re new to the SDK docs, here’s a short description of several popular modules:

Within each module, the reference docs are organized in this way:

* **Enumerations** - Typically these are events that you can listen to. Enums also include values of specific parameters for your actions.
* **Types** - Definitions of objects and the primitives that they contain. These objects are used in the actions below.
* **Functions** - Actions you can execute. Actions typically show the user something new or otherwise change the state of 3D Showcase.
